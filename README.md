# GPT Broker ðŸ’¼

GPT Broker keeps your OpenAI token out of frontend code and ensures only authenticated users access sensitive endpoints.

For Prometheus integration a /metrics endpoint with basic traffic information is exposed. Make sure public requests are denied from accessing it.

## Endpoints:

### /gpt-4o
Simple endpoint for 4o, supports temperature.
Request body:
```js
Request Header:
Authorization: Bearer <supabase-access-token>

Request Body:
{
    "messages": <string to query 4o with>,
    "temperature": <float between 0 and 1>
}
```

### /v2/advanced-gpt-4o-mini-complete
This version has small syntax tweaks and lets the caller specify a temperature to pass to gpt
  - **Request Headers:** - An Authorization header with the user's access token, in the format "Authorization": "Bearer <access_token>"
  - **Request Body:** An object with a "messages" field and an optional "temperature" field. Messages Must be a valid array of messages that ChatGPT accepts. Ie, in the format: `[ { role: 'system', content: "Write me a poem" }, ... ]`

### /advanced-gpt-4o-mini-complete
More complicated but allows full control over the prompts passed to ChatGPT. Requires:
  - **Autentication** - A header with the user's access token, in the format "Bearer <access_token>"
  - **messages** passed in the message body as JSON. Must be a valid array of messages that ChatGPT accepts. Ie, in the format: `[ { role: 'system', content: "Write me a poem" }, ... ]`

### /simple-gpt-4o-mini-complete
For simple requests that fit in a URL. Requires:
  - **prompt** - A URL parameter to give to ChatGPT
  - **Autentication** - A header with the user's access token, in the format "Bearer <access_token>"

### /metrics
Application metrics for Prometheus

## Setup:

Place two .env files in the root directory of this project. The first should have the information for the 
**SkillSyncDev** supabase project and it should have the name `.env.sksndev`. The second should have the 
information for the **techskillsync** supabase project and it should have the name `.env.techsksn`.

Both .env files should have the following fields:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key-here
REDIS_URL=redis://:@redis-stack:6379
DAILY_LIMIT=50
ID_WHITE_LIST=[]
```



## Testing:

There is a testing suite for both containers as well as the production endpoints. See the project in `test-gpt-broker` for more info.
